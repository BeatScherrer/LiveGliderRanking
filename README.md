# LiveGliderRanking
Live Glider ranking for competitions written in Python 3. This application is based on the great open source project 'Open Glider Network (OGN) http://wiki.glidernet.org/' and its python client https://github.com/glidernet/python-ogn-client. OGN provides real time glider data based on the anti collision system FLARM. I want to thank all the developers participating in those projects.
The main reason for this project is our gliding club hosting the swiss junior gliding championship in Dittingen. Glider tracking has been widely used in competitions but to my knowledge no application provides live task information such as average speed etc.

As a young, unexperienced and aspiring developer this project further provides an opportunity to gain experience in programming and project management.

## Dependencies
This application makes use of the following dependencies:

- Shapely
- Pyproj
- ogn-client
